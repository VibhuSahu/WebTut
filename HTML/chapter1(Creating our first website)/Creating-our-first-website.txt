We start building a website by creating a file named index.html,
Index.html is a special filename which is presented when the website root address is typed.


~ A BASIC HTML PAGE

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>


A tag is like a Container for either content or other HTML tags.

HTML Document   -------->    Browser    -------->    Rendered Page



~ Important Notes

1. Head & body tags are children of HTML tag.
2. HTML is the parent of Head & Body tags.
3. Most of the HTML elements have opening & closing tag with content in between opening & closing tags.
4. Some HTML tags have no content. These are called Empty elements eg<br>
5. WE can either use htm or html extension	
6. You can use "Inspect Elements" or "View Page Source" option from chrome to look into a website's HTML code.


		HTML element = start tag  +  Content  +  End tag

Not be parsed. They can help document the source code.

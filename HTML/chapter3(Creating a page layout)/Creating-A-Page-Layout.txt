				CHAPTER - 3 {CREATING A PAGE LAYOUT}


When we use the right tag in right place, it results in a better page layout, better indexing by search engines and better user experience.

We use the following tag to get the job done
	
	# Website Layout
	<header>	
	<main>		-contains nav tag
	<footer>

Inside the main tag we insert the following tags:
	
	<main>	  ----> The main opening tag
	<section> ----> A page section
	<article> ----> A self contained content
	<aside>   ----> Content aside from the content (eg. Ads etc)
	</main>   ----> The main closing tag

Creating a page like this is not necessary but it creates a readable & structured layout Also they are useful for SEO.


~ Link attributes
<a href="/contact"> Contact us </a>  ----> Contact page opens is same tab
<a href="/contact" target="_blank"> Contact us </a>  ----> Opens in a new tab


We can put any content inside an anchor tag (images, headings etc are all allowed) 


If the page is inside a directory, we need to make sure that we link to the correct page.  ---->  (Same applies to img tag as well)

We can add links to images like this

<a href="/about"> <img src="a.jpg" width="120"> </a>  ----> Height will be set automatically 



~ The DIV tag 
Div tag is often used as a container for other elements div is a block level element.   ---->  Always takes full width


~ The Span tag
Span is an inline container.   -----> Takes as much width as necessary
